# 4.3 - Challenge

The exercise below contains no input. Instead, a data structure for you to work with is stored in the `data` variable. Use that variable to create an Array that contains three items.

The first item should be an Array containing all of the values associated with any `name` key in the `data` variable.

The second item should contain the address found in the `data` variable.

And the third and final item should be `true` when the address is outside of California (CA) and `false` otherwise.
