# 4 - Variables & Logical Operators

In this tutorial we will go over two of the most critical tools we use when coding: defining variables and working with operators.

Variables are a way to store values with a given name so they can be later reused from different parts of your code, making the code cleaner and sometimes even more performant as values are calculated once.

[Operators](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/dw-operators) allow you to compare values and give you the basis to start making decisions with those comparisons.
