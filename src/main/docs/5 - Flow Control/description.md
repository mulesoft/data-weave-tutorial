# 5 - Flow Control

Flow control is used when you want to execute certain parts of your code in some situations, while not executing others. In other words, itâ€™s a way to add logic to your scripts.

In this tutorial we will go over some of the tools DataWeave offers for this, using what we learned on the previous one around logical operators.

We'll go over if/else constructs and the basics of [pattern matching](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/dataweave-pattern-matching).
